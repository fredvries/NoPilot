NoPilot 1.1

Microsoft Copilot is almost universally disliked due to its forced integration across Windows and Office, which many users find intrusive, distracting, and a disruption to established workflows. 

Critics often complain of 'AI slop': poorly executed, generic, or incorrect outputs, along with increased, unnecessary, and unremovable AI presence in daily tasks, making it feel like a forced, premium-cost annoyance rather than a helpful tool.

Copilot is heavily forced into the toolbar, right-click menus, and as a permanent, hard-to-remove icon in Windows 11, disrupting user experience.

Users frequently report generic, inaccurate, or redundant responses, often requiring more time to edit than to write from scratch. Frequent updates constantly change how Copilot works, creating inconsistency and frustrating users who want a stable, predictable environment. It frequently and frustatingly suffers from, or takes a long time for, complex tasks. Serious concerns exist regarding the potential exposure of sensitive documents due to misconfigured SharePoint or OneDrive permissions.

Users report that Copilot can act stubborn, refusing to acknowledge valid user approaches to problems.

Overall, the sentiment is that Copilot is often seen as an unnecessary, premature addition that prioritizes marketing hype over user-centric design.

Now there is NoPilot.

NoPilot mostly hides CoPilot as complete removal is no longer possible. Some visible parts are removed, others are blocked or disabled by NoPilot.
